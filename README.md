Input numbers by clicking on the screen buttons with the mouse or by pressing the corresponding keys
on keyboard. The full list of hotkeys is given in the section below.

#### Features

instead of the "=" button.

scientific notation input by yourself.
- If an error is thrown, no further operations are allowed, the result can only be reset
by pressing the "AC" button.
- The maximum length of the input field is 15 characters. If the total number of characters in the result
operation exceeds this number, an error will be generated.

is not possible.
